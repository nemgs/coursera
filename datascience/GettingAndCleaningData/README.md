#### Files included in the Data Set
* A CodeBook.md file describing the properties of the data in the data set.
* A README.md file describing the steps taken to transform the raw data into the tidy data set.
* A run_analysis.R file that contains the R code to transform the raw data into the tiday data set.

#### Executing the run_analysis.R file
Before executing the run_analysis file, you will need to unzip all the required files from the link included in the codebook.md in the working directory. The code assumes that all the files are present in the same directory.

Also, please note that while transforming the data according to the requirements asked in the assignment, some of the steps are done in order different from the question. The question number has been noted against each step in the code file to make this more clear.

Additional information about the data and its features will be found in the CodeBook.md file.
